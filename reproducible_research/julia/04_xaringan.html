An example of using the trailing comment `#&lt;&lt;` to highlight lines:


```r
kable.tab = knitr::kable(
  data) %&gt;% 
* kable_styling() %&gt;%
* scroll_box(width = "500px", height = "300px")
```

# Math Expressions

- Write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs: 

`$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$`

- **Source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs**
