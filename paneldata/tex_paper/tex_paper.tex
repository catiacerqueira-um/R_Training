\singlespacing {\small The existence of a link between exports and domestic demand challenges the
standard theoretical assumption in international trade models and carries
out important policy implications. In our empirical setup the estimated relationship
between exports and domestic sales results directly from a monopolistic
model of a firm selling to both domestic and external markets. We find a
noteworthy negative relationship between domestic demand and
firms' exports covering the manufacturing sector over the period 2009 -- 2016. This result holds for almost all industries although with a heterogeneous magnitude. Additionally, there is also evidence that this effect is stronger for larger firms.

\section{Introduction}

The empirical literature on the link between exports and domestic sales has
been gaining momentum over the last years. Such a development represents a
departure from standard international trade models where it is
assumed a constant marginal cost as in the seminal work by \cite{krugman1979increasing,krugman1980scale} and \cite{melitz2003impact}. Such an assumption implies that foreign and
domestic markets can be treated independently.

However, based on several alternative approaches, there is by now some evidence suggesting that the firm decisions are affected by both markets.\footnote{At the macro level, \cite{esteves2015there} present strong evidence of a
negative relationship between exports and domestic demand for Portugal
while \cite{bobeica2016exports} extend the supporting evidence to a panel of eleven Euro area countries.} \cite{vannoorenberghe2012firm} finds a negative relationship between exports and domestic sales for French firms, while, also for France, \cite{berman2015export} conclude that domestic sales are positively influenced by exports. \cite{altomonte2013firm} consider four European countries namely France, Germany, Italy and the UK and find that domestic demand conditions are important in driving export market participation with firms more likely to export during a downturn of the domestic market. \cite{BlumClaroHorstmann2013} document a negative relationship between exports and domestic sales for Chilean firms while \cite{AhnMcQuoid2017} find a negative correlation between domestic sales and exports for Indonesia. Drawing on data for Italian firms, \cite{bugamelli2015domestic} report a significant relationship between exports and domestic sales with the sign depending on the business cycle phase.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:model}, a theoretical model
underlying the link between exports and domestic demand is presented. The
dataset is described in Section \ref{sec:data} and the estimation strategy is discussed
in Section \ref{sec:est:strategy}. In Section \ref{sec:results}, the main empirical results are reported while Section \ref{sec:results:industries} explores the heterogeneity both across industries and firms size. Finally,
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Theoretical framework}\label{sec:model}

We consider two markets, a foreign
(F) and a domestic (D) market, which are assumed to be segmented so that
different prices can be charged by the firm in each market. By assuming
monopolistic competition, each firm $i$ at time $t$ faces a downward sloping demand curve in the foreign market, $q_{it}^{F}$, given as

\bigskip
\begin{equation}
q_{it}^{F}=\Phi _{t}^{F}z_{it}^{F}\left( p_{it}^{F}\right) ^{-\eta }
\label{qF demand}
\end{equation}%
\bigskip

\noindent where $\Phi _{t}^{F}$ represents the aggregate export market size, $%
z_{it}^{F}$ is a firm-specific export demand shifter, $p_{it}^{F}$ is the
firm's export price and $\eta >1$ is the price elasticity of demand (as in,
for example, \citealp{aw2011r} and \citealp{vannoorenberghe2012firm}). Hence, the corresponding inverse
demand function is given by

\bigskip
\begin{equation}
p_{it}^{F}=\left( \Phi _{t}^{F}z_{it}^{F}\right) ^{\frac{1}{\eta }}\left(
q_{it}^{F}\right) ^{-\frac{1}{\eta }}  \label{pF demand}
\end{equation}%

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Definitions and sources}

\subsubsection*{Exports}


Data for exports at the firm level are from the external trade database of
Statistics Portugal (INE), the Portuguese national statistical office, classified according to the 2010 Combined Nomenclature (NC) \citep{ine2018ci}. This database includes nominal values of internationally traded goods between Portugal and other Member States of the European Union (intra--EU trade) and between Portugal and non-EU countries (extra-EU trade). Data on extra-EU trade are collected from customs declarations, while data on intra--EU trade are collected through the Intrastat system. Each transaction record includes, among other information, the firm’s identifier, product code (8 digits), the destination country, the value of the transaction in Euro.

Several descriptive statistics are reported in Table \ref{tb:descriptives}. In particular, we provide a set of standard statistics for the following variables: exports, domestic sales, the ratio between domestic sales and exports, and foreign demand. We report statistics for the year 2009,\footnote{The year 2009 is the first year considered for estimation purposes due to the use of an instrumental variables procedure that makes use of lagged values of specific variables.} the last year available for this type of data which is 2016 and for the whole period. 

In Panel A, we consider all manufacturing firms leading to a sample of 21,749 observations and 3,996 firms. Looking at the figures for the ratio between domestic and exports sales, it is clear that this variable is being influenced by firms reporting a very small value for exports relatively to domestic sales. Therefore, in order to avoid the contamination of the results due to such extreme observations, another sample is considered. Firstly, all the firms reporting total sales less than one thousand Euro are excluded to avoid very small firms which are more prone to reporting errors. Secondly, firms are considered if exports represent at least one per cent of domestic sales or if domestic sales represent at least one per cent of exports. The idea is to narrow the analysis to firms that are effectively present in both markets. This sample has 19,381 observations and 3,655 firms (Panel B).  
Finally, a third sample is analysed (Panel C). As the theoretical model considered does not deal explicitly with the entry and exit of firms, the sample was further restricted to firms that are present in both markets in all periods as robustness analysis. This sample has 8,784 observations and 1,098 firms.

\section{Estimation strategy}\label{sec:est:strategy}

The model to be estimated corresponds to equation
\begin{equation}
X_{it}=\beta_{i0}\;FD_{it}^{\beta_{1}}\;\left(1+\dfrac{DD_{i,t}}{FD_{i,t}}%
\right)^{\beta_{2}}  \label{equation estimated}
\bigskip 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $X_{it}$ is exports by firm \textit{i} in period \textit{t}, $\beta_{1}$ is expected to be positive and $\beta_{2}$
negative as discussed earlier. An important feature of this specification is that exports depend on the relative importance between both markets. As it is clear, the elasticity of exports to domestic demand is not constant, depending on the relative dimension between the two markets which can differ across firms and over time. More formally, one can show that using equation (\ref{equation estimated}), the exports elasticities to foreign demand, $\varepsilon_{x,fd}$, and domestic demand, $\varepsilon_{x,dd}$, are given, respectively, by

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{x,fd} = \beta_{1} - \beta_{2} \dfrac{R}{1+R}\label{eq:elast:fd}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
	\varepsilon_{x,dd} = \beta_{2} \dfrac{R}{1+R}\label{eq:elast:dd}
\bigskip
\end{equation}

\noindent where \textit{R} stands for the ratio between domestic ($DD_{it}$) and foreign ($FD_{it}$) demands. Figure \ref{fig:elasticities} depicts the relation between the model coefficients $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ and the above elasticities considering that $\beta _{1} > 0$ and $\beta _{2} < 0$. As the domestic market becomes more important, in relative terms, the elasticities of exports to foreign demand and domestic demand asymptotically converge towards $\beta_{1}$ -- $\beta_{2}$ and to $\beta_{2}$, respectively.

	\caption{Exports elasticities}
	\label{fig:elasticities}
\end{figure}


Intuitively, in the case of $\varepsilon_{x,dd}$, a percentage decrease in domestic sales that ends up being reoriented to the export market, will translate into a large (small) elasticity, in absolute terms, if domestic sales are large (small) in relative terms. Naturally, if there are no domestic sales, then no reorientation is possible and the elasticity is zero. In the case of $\varepsilon_{x,fd}$, if there are no domestic sales, the elasticity is given by $\beta_{1}$. As the domestic market gets more important, there is scope for reorientation, and the elasticity is higher.

\section{Empirical results}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Main results}\label{sec:results:main}

The estimations are reported in Table \ref{tb:regression}. The design of the different specifications and estimators is the following. First, we estimate the `traditional' log-linear model by fixed-effects, column `$ln\left (X_{it} \right )$ (FE)'. The dependent variable is the natural log of firms' exports. We assume the fixed-effects procedure is able to tackle all endogeneity issues associated with this specification.
Second, following the discussion in \cite{silva2006log} and in \cite{egger2015panel}, we account for heteroskedasticity and implement a (pseudo-maximum-likelihood) fixed-effects Poisson estimator. The dependent variable is now firms' exports (in levels), as described in equation (\ref{equation estimated}). The results are shown under column `$X_{it}$ (FE Poisson)'.
